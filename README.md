# Metro-Path-Finder
This Java-based project simulates a metro network and finds the shortest path between two stations using Dijkstra's algorithm. It allows users to input starting and destination stations and calculates the shortest travel time in minutes.

Features
Graph Representation: The metro network is represented as a graph with stations as nodes and routes as edges.
Shortest Path Calculation: Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between any two stations.
User Interaction: Users can input starting and destination stations to receive the shortest travel time.
Scalable: Easily extendable to add more stations and routes.
